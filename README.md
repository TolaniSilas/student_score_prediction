# Student Score Prediction Project

This project employs machine learning techniques to predict the percentage of score attained by a student based on the number of hours they study per day.

## Overview

Understanding and predicting student performance is crucial for educational institutions. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict a student's score based on the number of hours they dedicate to studying each day.

## Project Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- Analyzes the correlation between study hours and exam scores.
- Provides insights into student performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
